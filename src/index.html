<p>I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason:
    he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books
    about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all
    these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were
    once children - although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>
